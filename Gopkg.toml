# This is intended to tell `dep` to not scan for dependencies the files inside
# the `tools` directory, as those aren't really part of this project, but copied
# from the `openshift/release` tool project, as described here:
#
#   https://github.com/openshift/release/tree/master/tools/hack/golang
#
# Note that this works, but it is taking advantage of the fact that `dep`
# assumes that there is a direct relationship between the name of the directory
# and the import path, which is not always true. For example, the import path of
# the `junitreport` project is `github.com/openshift/origin/tools/junitreport`
# and not `github.com/openshift/autoheal/tools`.
