# This section describes how to throttle the execution of healing rules.
throttling:
  #
  # The time that the service will remember an executed healing action. If an
  # action is triggered more than once in the given interval it will be executed
  # only the first time. The rest of the times it will be logged and ignored.
  #
  # Note that for throttling purposes actions are considered the same if they
  # have exactly the same fields with exactly the same values *after* processing
  # them as templates.  For example, an action defined like this:
  #
  #   awxJob:
  #     template: "Restart {{ $labels.service }}"
  #
  # Will have different values for the `template` field if the triggering alerts
  # have different `service` labels.
  #
  interval: 1h

#
# This section contains the healing rules.
#
rules:

#
# This rule runs an the `Start Node` AWX job when the `NodeDown` alert
# is fired. The playbook that handles this alert is expected to take the
# name of the node from the `node` variable, so we need to translate the
# `instance` label into the `node` variable passed in the `extraVars`.
#

    name: start-node
  labels:

  awxJob:

    extraVars: |-
      {
        "node": "{{ $labels.instance }}"
      }

#
# This rule runs a batch job that uses Python to say hello when the
# `NewFriend` alert is fired. The alert is expected to have a `name`
# label containing the name of the new friend.
